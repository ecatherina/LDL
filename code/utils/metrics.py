    The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample
    that is negative.
    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.
    The F-beta score can be interpreted as a weighted harmonic mean of
    the precision and recall, where an F-beta score reaches its best
    value at 1 and worst score at 0.
    The F-beta score weights recall more than precision by a factor of
    ``beta``. ``beta == 1.0`` means recall and precision are equally important.
    The support is the number of occurrences of each class in ``y_true``.
    If ``pos_label is None`` and in binary classification, this function
    returns the average precision, recall and F-measure if ``average``

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Ground truth (correct) target values.
    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.
    beta : float, default=1.0
        The strength of recall versus precision in the F-score.
    labels : array-like, default=None
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets,
        labels are column indices. By default, all labels in ``y_true`` and
        ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.
    pos_label : str or int, default=1
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass or multilabel, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.
    average : {'binary', 'micro', 'macro', 'samples','weighted'}, \
            default=None
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:
        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).
    warn_for : tuple or set, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.
    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.
    zero_division : "warn", 0 or 1, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division:
           - recall: when there are no positive labels
           - precision: when there are no positive predictions
           - f-score: both
        If set to "warn", this acts as 0, but warnings are also raised.
    Returns
    -------
    precision : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
    recall : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
    fbeta_score : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
    support : None (if average is not None) or array of int, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        The number of occurrences of each label in ``y_true``.
    Notes
    -----
    When ``true positive + false positive == 0``, precision is undefined.
    When ``true positive + false negative == 0``, recall is undefined.
    In such cases, by default the metric will be set to 0, as will f-score,
    and ``UndefinedMetricWarning`` will be raised. This behavior can be
    modified with ``zero_division``.

        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : list, optional

        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a

    pos_label : str or int, optional (default=1)
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report

    average : str or None, optional (default=None)
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an

        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).
    warn_for : tuple or set, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Sample weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : list, optional
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average.

    pos_label : str or int, optional (default=1)
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : str or None, optional (default=None)
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    warn_for : tuple or set, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Sample weights.

    """Compute the geometric mean

    The geometric mean (G-mean) is the root of the product of class-wise
    sensitivity. This measure tries to maximize the accuracy on each of the
    classes while keeping these accuracies balanced. For binary classification
    G-mean is the squared root of the product of the sensitivity
    and specificity. For multi-class problems it is a higher root of the
    product of sensitivity for each class.

    For compatibility with other imbalance performance measures, G-mean can be
    calculated for each class separately on a one-vs-rest basis when
    ``average != 'multiclass'``.

    The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0. Traditionally if at least one
    class is unrecognized by the classifier, G-mean resolves to zero. To
    alleviate this property, for highly multi-class the sensitivity of
    unrecognized classes can be "corrected" to be a user specified value
    (instead of zero). This option works only if ``average == 'multiclass'``.

        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted

        ``'weighted'``:

    sample_weight : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Sample weights.

    correction: float, optional (default=0.0)

def make_index_balanced_accuracy(alpha=0.1, squared=True):
    """Balance any scoring function using the index balanced accuracy

    This factory function wraps scoring function to express it as the
    index balanced accuracy (IBA). You need to use this function to
    decorate any scoring function.

    Only metrics requiring ``y_pred`` can be corrected with the index
    balanced accuracy. ``y_score`` cannot be used since the dominance
    cannot be computed.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <imbalanced_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, optional (default=0.1)
        Weighting factor.

    squared : bool, optional (default=True)
        If ``squared`` is True, then the metric computed will be squared
        before to be weighted.

    Returns
    -------
    iba_scoring_func : callable,
        Returns the scoring metric decorated which will automatically compute
        the index balanced accuracy.

    Notes
    -----
    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_evaluation_plot_metrics.py`.
